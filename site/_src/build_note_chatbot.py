<section class="nx-take"><h2>The answer in forty words</h2><ul>
<li>A chatbot answers questions. A digital employee does one named job, inside the systems you already own.</li>
<li>The difference is not intelligence. It is memory, scope, permissions, a log, and a person who signs off.</li>
<li>That is why one is sold per seat and the other is priced against the salary it absorbs.</li>
<li>If a supplier cannot tell you which of the two they are selling, they are selling the first one.</li>
</ul></section>

<p>Almost every business conversation about AI this year has collapsed two different products into one word, and the collapse is expensive. It is the reason a managing director can come out of a demo impressed and still be unable to say what they bought. So this note does the boring thing properly: it puts the two objects side by side and takes them apart.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-is">What the two things actually are</h2>
<p>A <b>chatbot</b> is an interface over a large language model. You type, it answers. Modern versions are genuinely good at drafting, summarising, rewriting, explaining a policy, or turning a page of notes into an email. Sold per seat, usually monthly, priced like software because that is what it is: a tool that a person operates.</p>
<p>A <b>digital employee</b> is a different object. It has a job, a name, a place in the workflow, a definition of what it must never do, and a human who is accountable for its output. It does not wait to be asked. It picks up work from a queue, does one repeating sequence inside the software the business already runs, records what it did, and stops when something falls outside its scope.</p>
<p>The distinction is not philosophical. It changes what you can delegate. You cannot delegate a job to something that has no job description, and you cannot be accountable for output from something that keeps no record.</p>

<h2 id="the-five">The five differences</h2>
""")
body.append(FIVE)
body.append("""
<p>Read that table as a list of things that have to exist before work can leave a person's desk. A tool can be excellent and still have none of them, because none of them are intelligence problems. They are design decisions about scope, records and authority.</p>

<h2 id="the-money">The money, and why it is priced differently</h2>
<p>This is where the comparison stops being academic. A tool is priced against other tools, which is why the subscription column of a software bill is full of small numbers. A job is priced against the person doing it, which is why the number is larger and why the argument is different.</p>
<p>Take one UK administrator on £28,000. Add 25% for employer National Insurance, pension and the overhead of a desk, a laptop and management time, and the real annual cost is about <b>£35,000</b>. Divide by twelve: <b>£2,917 a month</b>. Divide by roughly 1,950 productive hours: <b>£17.95 an hour</b>.</p>
<p>That is the comparator. Not a software licence. Not a competitor's price list. The cost of the work as it is currently being paid for.</p>
<div class="wk"><span class="r"></span><b>£28,000 salary → £35,000 loaded → £2,917 a month → £17.95 an hour</b><b>A monthly workflow at £750 is 26% of that hire. A full desk at £3,500 is £60,000 a year, and has to replace about 1.7 salaries or add £60,000 of revenue.</b></div>
<p>Two consequences follow, and both are uncomfortable. First, a cheap implementation that only drafts text is competing with a £20 subscription, and it will lose. Second, an expensive implementation that does not displace countable work is competing with a salary it cannot beat. The only defensible price sits between those two, and it can only be found by naming the job and counting what it costs today.</p>

<h2 id="three-confusions">Three ways the pair get confused</h2>
<p><b>The demo effect.</b> A chatbot demo is a conversation, so it always looks impressive. A digital employee demo is a queue emptying, which looks like admin. Buyers consistently choose the more exciting demo and then wonder why nothing changed.</p>
<p><b>The wrapper problem.</b> Some suppliers put a job-shaped wrapper around a general assistant: a prompt, a name, a friendly avatar. It answers questions about invoices. It cannot open one, because it has no access, no permission and no record. The wrapper is the tell, not the product.</p>
<p><b>The accountability gap.</b> Ask who is responsible when the output is wrong and you will hear a version of "the model". That answer means nobody. A digital employee has a person's name against consequential actions, and a log that says exactly what happened and when.</p>

<h2 id="when-a-chatbot">When a chatbot is the right answer</h2>
<p>Often, honestly. If the need is to draft, summarise, translate, explain or brainstorm, buy a seat and stop there. If the work is genuinely a tool for a person to operate, a digital employee is an expensive way to solve it.</p>
<p>The test is simple: can you name the repeating task, say how often it happens, and count what it costs now? If yes, it is a job and it can be delegated. If the answer is a shrug, the need is a tool, or it is nothing at all.</p>

<h2 id="seven-questions">Seven questions to ask before buying either</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>What exactly does it produce, and who receives it?</b> An answer, or a file, a booking, a chased document, a closed case. Vague output means vague scope.</li>
<li><b>Where does it keep what it learns about us?</b> If the answer is "in the conversation", it has no memory, whatever the marketing says.</li>
<li><b>What is it not allowed to do?</b> A supplier who cannot list prohibitions has not thought about the job.</li>
<li><b>Show me the log of one completed task, end to end.</b> Not a dashboard. A record of what it touched, in what order, and what it changed.</li>
<li><b>When it stops, who does it escalate to, and how fast?</b> The escalation rule is the safety design. If it has none, the failure is silent.</li>
<li><b>What does it cost per month, and what job does that replace?</b> Any answer that does not name the job is a software sale dressed up.</li>
<li><b>How do we prove it worked in two weeks?</b> There should be a number, agreed in advance, measured on your own material.</li>
</ol>

<section class="nx-twinthos"><h2>What Twinthos sells, in one paragraph</h2>
<p>A digital employee has three parts. A <b>Brain</b>: the company's own rules and history, isolated per client, never invented. A <b>job definition</b>: one repeating task, written down, with its prohibitions and its escalation rule. A <b>desk</b>: it works through the screens you already own, so there is no API to build and no migration to survive.</p>
<p>The model underneath is fuel and it is swappable. The value is the memory, the scope, the permissions and the record.</p>
<p>Every engagement starts with one job and one number, measured on the client's own documents. If it cannot be measured, we say so and do not sell it.</p>
<p>No client has bought this as paid work yet, so this page claims no results, no savings and no case study. What it can offer is a short, countable pilot and the arithmetic above, which anyone can check.</p>

<p>That a digital employee replaces a team. It replaces a job, and jobs are smaller than teams. That it never makes mistakes: it will, which is why the job is scoped so a rule catches them and why the pilot measures the rate.
