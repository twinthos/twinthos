     "A log of one completed task, end to end, with the records it touched. It is hard to fake, quick to read, and "
     "it tells you more about the design than any demo."),
    ("Should we ask for references?",
     "Yes, and ask what went wrong in the first month. A supplier with no live clients can still be credible if they "
     "say so plainly and offer a measured pilot instead; a supplier who invents a case study cannot be trusted about "
     "anything else."),

<p>We sell one job at a time, defined in writing, run through the screens you already own. The memory is yours and exportable. The model is swappable fuel. A named person in your business approves anything consequential, and every action is logged and reversible.</p>
<p>No client has bought this as paid work yet, so we have no case study to show you and we will not invent one. What we can offer instead is the job definition written with you, and a short pilot measured on your own documents.</p>
